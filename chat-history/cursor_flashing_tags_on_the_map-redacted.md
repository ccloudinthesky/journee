like the "2" and "3" corcle on the map, these tags are related to the places in the schedule, but they always keep flashing? especialy when I drag the map to see other places

now I want to modify the location of location info when clicking. like these two picture, they all appear far from the location on the map, and seems like every time the info card would show at somewhere wrong place and do not have a trend that every time appear left to the correct location. I hope the info can appear just on the top of the location

如果是不同的行程的話，那我一點進去他應該會顯示的地圖範圍是那個行程裡面的所有設計到的那一區像我現在會如果前面現在A的地圖，那我跳出去轉到B之後一點進去他的區域還是會停在看他的A就沒有自動調整就不對
